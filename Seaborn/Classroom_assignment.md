# Classroom Assignment: Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas and Seaborn

## Overview

In this assignment, you will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the "tips" dataset (a built-in dataset in Seaborn containing restaurant tips and related information). You will use **Pandas** for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation and **Seaborn** for creating informative visualizations. This assignment simulates a real-world scenario where you, as a data analyst, need to analyze restaurant performance and customer behavior to derive insights.

## Objectives

- **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Import the dataset using Pandas, inspect its structure, and handle any missing or inconsistent values.
- **Data Manipulation:** Use grouping, sorting, and filtering operations to extract key information from the dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Create a variety of plots using Seaborn to analyze distributions, categorical differences, and correlations.
- **Interpretation:** Develop insights based on the calculated statistics and visualizations.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Loading and Inspection

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - Import `pandas` as `pd` and `seaborn` as `sns`.
   - Also import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` for plot display.

2. **Load the Dataset:**
   - Load the "tips" dataset using Seaborn’s built-in function: `sns.load_dataset("tips")`.
   - Display the first few rows of the DataFrame.
   - Print the DataFrame’s shape, column names, and data types.
   - Check for any missing values and comment on the overall completeness of the dataset.

### Task 2: Data Manipulation and Analysis

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns such as `total_bill` and `tip` using Pandas methods.
   - Generate frequency counts for categorical columns (such as `day` and `smoker`).

2. **GroupBy and Aggregation:**
   - Group the DataFrame by `day` and compute the average `total_bill` and `tip` for each day.
   - Group by `smoker` status and calculate the total sum and mean for `total_bill`.

3. **Sorting and Filtering:**
   - Sort the DataFrame based on `total_bill` in descending order.
   - Filter out rows where the tip is above a certain threshold (e.g., tips greater than 8) to analyze high-tipping customers.


### Task 3: Data Visualization with Seaborn

1. **Distribution Plots:**
   - Create a **Histogram with KDE** (using `sns.histplot` with `kde=True`) for the `total_bill` column.
   - Explain what the histogram and KDE reveal about the distribution of bills.

2. **Categorical Plots:**
   - Generate a **Box Plot** showing `total_bill` distribution across different `days` of the week.
   - Create a **Violin Plot** for `tip` distributions grouped by `smoker` status.
   - Use a **Strip Plot** or **Swarm Plot** to visualize individual data points for `total_bill` versus `day`.

3. **Matrix Plot:**
   - Calculate the correlation matrix for numeric columns.
   - Create a **Heatmap** to visualize the correlations between variables like `total_bill`, `tip`, and `size`.

4. **Pair Plot (Optional):**
   - Generate a **Pair Plot** for the numerical columns, coloring the points by `day` or `smoker` to observe pairwise relationships.

### Task 4: Reporting and Interpretation

1. **Summary Report:**
   - Write a brief summary (as comments or in a separate Markdown cell/document) discussing:
     - The key descriptive statistics you observed.
     - Any notable differences in spending behavior across different days and between smokers and non-smokers.
     - Insights gained from the visualizations (e.g., distribution shape, outliers, correlations).

2. **Real-World Relevance:**
   - Explain how a restaurant manager might use these insights to make decisions (e.g., staffing on busy days, targeted promotions for high-tipping customers).

## Deliverables

- A well-commented Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - All code from Tasks 1 to 4.
  - Inline comments explaining each step.
  - A final summary section (or Markdown cell) with your interpretations and recommendations based on the analysis.
- The completed assignment should demonstrate your ability to load data with Pandas, manipulate and analyze the data, and create informative visualizations using Seaborn.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness:** The code runs without errors and generates the expected outputs.
- **Clarity:** The code is well-commented and structured, making the workflow easy to follow.
- **Insightfulness:** The analysis and summary provide meaningful insights and reflect a good understanding of the data.
- **Real-World Application:** The interpretations tie the analysis back to practical decisions a restaurant manager might need to make.

### Tips for Students

- Work through the tasks incrementally. Test your code frequently to catch errors early.
- Use the provided code snippets as a starting point, but feel free to experiment with additional visualizations or analysis techniques.
- Make sure your final report clearly explains both your process and your conclusions.

Good luck, and enjoy exploring the data with Pandas and Seaborn!
