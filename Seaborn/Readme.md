## Distribution Plots

Distribution plots are used to visualize the distribution (density and frequency) of a dataset.

### Histplot
*Formerly known as `distplot` (now deprecated), `histplot` is used to plot histograms with the option to overlay a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE).*

- **Usage:** Visualizing the frequency and density of continuous data.
- **Interpretation:** Histograms show how often data points fall within certain ranges, while the KDE provides a smooth estimate of the distribution.

**Example Code:**
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = np.random.randn(1000)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.histplot(data, bins=30, kde=True, stat="density")
plt.title("Distribution Plot (histplot) of Random Data")
plt.xlabel("Value")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.show()
```

### Joint Plot
*A joint plot displays the relationship between two variables along with their marginal distributions.*

- **Usage:** Explore bivariate relationships and view individual distributions.
- **Interpretation:** The scatter plot in the center shows the relationship between variables; the side histograms or KDE plots show the distribution for each variable.

**Example Code:**
```python
x = np.random.randn(1000)
y = x * 0.5 + np.random.randn(1000) * 0.5
sns.jointplot(x=x, y=y, kind="scatter", height=8)
plt.suptitle("Joint Plot: Scatter with Marginal Distributions", y=1.02)
plt.show()
```

### Pair Plot
*A pair plot creates a matrix of scatter plots for all combinations of variables in a dataset.*

- **Usage:** Ideal for multivariate analysis, such as with the Iris dataset.
- **Interpretation:** Diagonal plots usually show the distribution of each variable, while the off-diagonals show the relationship between pairs of variables.

**Example Code:**
```python
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")
sns.pairplot(iris, hue="species")
plt.suptitle("Pair Plot of the Iris Dataset", y=1.02)
plt.show()
```

### Rug Plot
*A rug plot adds small tick marks along the x-axis to denote individual observations.*

- **Usage:** Provides a quick sense of data density along a single axis.
- **Interpretation:** Dense clustering of ticks indicates regions with higher data concentration.

**Example Code:**
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.rugplot(data)
plt.title("Rug Plot of Random Data")
plt.xlabel("Value")
plt.show()
```

### KDE Plot
*KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plots provide a smooth curve representing the data distribution.*

- **Usage:** Useful when you want to visualize the underlying probability density of a dataset.
- **Interpretation:** Peaks in the KDE plot indicate regions of high data concentration.

**Example Code:**
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.kdeplot(data, fill=True)
plt.title("KDE Plot of Random Data")
plt.xlabel("Value")
plt.ylabel("Density")
plt.show()
```

## Categorical Data Plots

Categorical plots are used to visualize data where categories play a key role.

### Catplot (Swarm Plot)
*Catplot is a versatile function that can create different types of categorical plots. In our example, we used it to create a swarm plot.*

- **Usage:** Illustrates distribution of a numeric variable across different categories.
- **Interpretation:** Shows individual data points and reveals clusters or gaps within each category.

**Example Code:**
```python
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
g = sns.catplot(x="day", y="total_bill", hue="smoker", data=tips, kind="swarm", height=6)
g.fig.suptitle("Catplot (Swarm) of Total Bill by Day, Separated by Smoker Status", y=0.95)
plt.show()
```

### Box Plot
*Box plots summarize data through quartiles and identify outliers.*

- **Usage:** Compare the distribution and spread of numerical data across categories.
- **Interpretation:** The box shows the interquartile range (IQR), the line inside represents the median, and the whiskers mark variability outside the upper and lower quartiles.

**Example Code:**
```python
sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)
plt.title("Box Plot of Total Bill by Day")
plt.xlabel("Day")
plt.ylabel("Total Bill")
plt.show()
```

### Violin Plot
*Violin plots combine box plot features with a KDE plot to show the full distribution shape.*

- **Usage:** Offers a deeper insight into the data distribution beyond quartiles.
- **Interpretation:** Widely spread areas in the violin shape indicate a higher density of values.

**Example Code:**
```python
sns.violinplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)
plt.title("Violin Plot of Total Bill by Day")
plt.xlabel("Day")
plt.ylabel("Total Bill")
plt.show()
```

### Strip Plot
*Strip plots display individual data points using a scatter plot along categorical axes.*

- **Usage:** To visualize all observations and identify potential overlaps.
- **Interpretation:** When points overlap, jitter (random noise) can be applied to show the density.

**Example Code:**
```python
sns.stripplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips, jitter=True)
plt.title("Strip Plot of Total Bill by Day")
plt.xlabel("Day")
plt.ylabel("Total Bill")
plt.show()
```

### Swarm Plot
*Swarm plots adjust the position of points to ensure they do not overlap.*

- **Usage:** Ideal when you want to display every data point clearly.
- **Interpretation:** Provides an accurate view of distribution within categories.

**Example Code:**
```python
sns.swarmplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)
plt.title("Swarm Plot of Total Bill by Day")
plt.xlabel("Day")
plt.ylabel("Total Bill")
plt.show()
```

### Bar Plot
*Bar plots summarize data by calculating central tendencies (e.g., the mean) for each category.*

- **Usage:** Compare averages or totals between categories.
- **Interpretation:** The height of the bars represents the magnitude of the measured variable.

**Example Code:**
```python
sns.barplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips, estimator=np.mean)
plt.title("Bar Plot: Average Total Bill by Day")
plt.xlabel("Day")
plt.ylabel("Average Total Bill")
plt.show()
```

### Count Plot
*Count plots show the number of observations in each categorical bin.*

- **Usage:** To quickly assess the frequency distribution of categorical variables.
- **Interpretation:** The length of the bars represents the count of entries within each category.

**Example Code:**
```python
sns.countplot(x="day", data=tips)
plt.title("Count Plot: Number of Orders by Day")
plt.xlabel("Day")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

## Matrix Plots

### Heatmap
*A heatmap visualizes a matrix of data values, usually used to represent correlation matrices.*

- **Usage:** Identify patterns or correlations between multiple variables.
- **Interpretation:** 
  - **Color intensity** represents the magnitude of the correlation (or other metric).
  - Annotated cells help pinpoint the exact value.
  - A well-designed heatmap quickly communicates which variables are strongly related (positively or negatively).

**Example Code:**
```python
# To avoid errors, only numeric columns should be considered.
numeric_tips = tips.select_dtypes(include=["number"])
corr_matrix = numeric_tips.corr()

sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
plt.title("Heatmap of Correlation Matrix (Tips Dataset - Numeric Columns Only)")
plt.show()
```
