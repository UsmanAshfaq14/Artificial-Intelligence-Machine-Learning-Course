"""Difference Between Private and Protected in Python:

Private Members:

Syntax: Defined with a double underscore prefix (e.g., __var).

Name Mangling: Python renames these members internally (e.g., __var in class MyClass becomes _MyClass__var), making direct access from outside the class harder.

Intent: Indicates that the member is meant for internal use only, not to be accessed or overridden by subclasses or external code.

Protected Members:

Syntax: Defined with a single underscore prefix (e.g., _var).

Convention Only: They are not enforced by Pythonâ€”this is simply a convention signaling that these members are for internal use within the class and its subclasses.

Intent: Suggests caution when accessing these members from outside the class; they can be accessed, but you should treat them as non-public. Subclasses are encouraged to use them, but external code should avoid it."""
