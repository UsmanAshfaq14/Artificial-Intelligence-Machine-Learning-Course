## Probability
Probability is a measure that quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring within a defined sample space. The probability of an event $$A$$ is defined as:

$$ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} $$

Key points include:
- **Sample Space:** The set of all possible outcomes.
- **Event:** A subset of the sample space.
- **Axioms of Probability:** Including non-negativity, normalization ($$ P(S) = 1 $$), and additivity for mutually exclusive events.

## Joint, Marginal, and Conditional Probability
Understanding the relationship between events is crucial in probability theory.

### Joint Probability
- **Definition:** The probability of two events $$A$$ and $$B$$ occurring simultaneously is denoted as $$ P(A \cap B) $$.
- **Formula:** For independent events, it simplifies to:
  
$$ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) $$

### Marginal Probability
- **Definition:** The probability of an event irrespective of the outcomes of other variables. It is obtained by summing or integrating over the possible values of the other variables.
- **Example:** If $$A$$ and $$B$$ are joint events, then the marginal probability of $$A$$ is:

$$ P(A) = \sum_{B} P(A, B) $$

### Conditional Probability
- **Definition:** The probability of an event $$A$$ given that another event $$B$$ has occurred is denoted as $$ P(A|B) $$.
- **Formula:**

$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad \text{(provided } P(B) > 0\text{)} $$

- **Bayesâ€™ Theorem:** An essential tool for updating probabilities:

$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} $$

## Probability Distributions
Probability distributions describe how probabilities are assigned to different outcomes. They are broadly categorized into:

### Discrete Probability
- **Definition:** Deals with countable outcomes.
- **Examples:** Binomial, Poisson, and Geometric distributions.

### Continuous Probability
- **Definition:** Deals with outcomes over a continuous range.
- **Examples:** Normal, Exponential, and Uniform distributions.

## Specific Probability Distributions

### Normal Distribution
- **Definition:** Also known as the Gaussian distribution, it is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve.
- **Key Parameters:** Mean ($$ \mu $$) and Standard Deviation ($$ \sigma $$).
- **Formula:**

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \, e^{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} } $$

- **Properties:** Symmetric about the mean, where approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three.

### Binomial Distribution
- **Definition:** A discrete distribution representing the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
- **Key Parameters:** Number of trials ($$ n $$) and probability of success in a single trial ($$ p $$).
- **Formula:**

$$ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} \, p^k \, (1-p)^{n-k} $$

- **Applications:** Used in scenarios with two possible outcomes (e.g., success/failure, yes/no).

### Poisson Distribution
- **Definition:** A discrete distribution expressing the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
- **Key Parameter:** The average number of occurrences ($$ \lambda $$).
- **Formula:**

$$ P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k \, e^{-\lambda}}{k!} $$

- **Applications:** Commonly used for modeling rare events.

## Bayesian Probability
Bayesian probability offers a framework for updating beliefs in light of new evidence. It is fundamentally based on Bayes' theorem:

$$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} $$

Where:
- $$ P(H) $$ is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- $$ P(E|H) $$ is the likelihood of observing the evidence given the hypothesis.
- $$ P(E) $$ is the total probability of the evidence.
- $$ P(H|E) $$ is the posterior probability after taking the evidence into account.

### Key Concepts:
- **Prior:** Initial belief before seeing the data.
- **Posterior:** Updated belief after incorporating the evidence.
- **Likelihood:** Probability of observing the data under different hypotheses.
- **Bayesian Inference:** A method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.
