# Data Analysis Techniques: Correlation, Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate

This repository explores various data analysis techniques, with a focus on correlation and its visual representations, as well as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. The theoretical foundations, formulas, and working principles described here are based on detailed explanations and examples originally inspired by Geeks for Geeks.

## Correlation
Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the degree to which two variables are linearly related. Its value ranges from -1 to +1:
- **+1:** Perfect positive correlation (both variables move in the same direction)
- **-1:** Perfect negative correlation (one variable increases as the other decreases)
- **0:** No linear correlation

### Key Formula
The **Pearson correlation coefficient** is one of the most commonly used measures and is defined as:

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

Where:
- \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) are individual data points,
- \( \bar{x} \) and \( \bar{y} \) represent the means of the respective datasets,
- \( n \) is the total number of observations.

Other correlation measures, such as **Spearman's rank correlation** and **Kendall's tau**, are available for non-parametric data or when the assumptions of Pearson's method are not met.

## Correlation Visual Representation
Visualizing correlation helps in understanding the relationships between variables more intuitively. Common techniques include:

- **Scatter Plots:** These plots depict individual data points on a Cartesian plane, making it easy to see the direction, form, and strength of the relationship.
- **Heatmaps:** Often used to visualize correlation matrices, heatmaps provide a color-coded representation of correlation coefficients among multiple variables.
- **Pair Plots:** Also known as scatterplot matrices, pair plots display multiple scatter plots for all variable combinations, offering a comprehensive view of inter-variable relationships.

## Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis examines a single variable at a time to summarize and find patterns in the data. Key components include:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Visual Tools:** Histograms, bar charts, and box plots that depict the distribution, central tendency, and spread of the data.

This analysis lays the groundwork for understanding the basic characteristics of the data before delving into more complex relationships.

## Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis involves the examination of two variables to determine the empirical relationship between them. Methods include:

- **Scatter Plots:** Ideal for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables.
- **Cross-tabulations:** Useful for summarizing the relationship between two categorical variables.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Quantifying the degree of linear association between variables using coefficients like Pearson's r.

This form of analysis is essential for identifying patterns, trends, and potential causal relationships between variables.

## Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis extends the scope to three or more variables simultaneously. This type of analysis helps in understanding the complex interplay among multiple factors. Techniques include:

- **Multiple Regression Analysis:** Predicts the outcome of a dependent variable based on several independent variables.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information.
- **Cluster Analysis:** Groups observations into clusters based on similarities across multiple variables.

These methods are invaluable in scenarios where data complexity and interdependencies are high.
